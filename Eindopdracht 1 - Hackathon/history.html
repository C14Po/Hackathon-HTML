							Incidental music, classical and the silent era
						</h3>
						<p>
							Incidental music was written to accompany stage plays. Many of
							Shakespeare’s works incorporated incidental music. Bij the 19th
							century such music was commonplace. When silent films began to
							appear <strong>(mid 1890's-1920's)</strong>, music was the most
							important way to set the mood, with film scores being improvised
							in real time. The first score specifically written for a film was
							by famous composer Camille Saint-Saëns. The planets (1916) an
							orchestral suite bij Gustav Holst, has been of great influence on
							more recent composers, notably John Williams (Star Wars Imperial
							March) and Hans Zimmmer (Gladiator).

						<p>
							“Talkies” soon appeared, and music formed an integral part of the
							soundtrack. The first completely original score for a movie with
							sound was composed by Max Steiner, for “King Kong” in 1933. The
							<strong>40's and 50's</strong> is a unique period in the history
							of film scoring, where original songs were written for the movies.
							Composers during this period primarily come from backgrounds in
							concert music, and almost exclusively write orchestral pieces,
							though jazz sounds start to make an entrance. In the
							<strong>1960's</strong> rock music appeared in films. Composers
							would experiment with instruments and new sounds.

							Synthesized sound and minimalist approach
						</h3>
						<p>
							In the <strong>1970s</strong> New Hollywood era, film music heads
							in two concurrent, divergent directions with the incorporation of
							synthesizers and a return to classic scoring. John Williams
							single-handedly revives the sound of golden age Hollywood
							(orchestral) with his score for Star Wars. Synthesized sound in
							films first occurred in the <strong>1980s</strong> and it
							revolutionized film scoring. This meant that an entire film could
							be scored using just one performer. <strong>Today</strong> there
							are composers who tend towards a more minimalistic approach to
							composing, such as Hans Zimmer. He continues to be influential,
							thanks to his extensive and innovative use of technology and
							hyper-collaborative approach to music production.
